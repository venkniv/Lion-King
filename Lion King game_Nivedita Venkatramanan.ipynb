    "    A) Introduction:\n",
    "    This game is based on the Disney movie The Lion King (1994). \n",
    "    The game consists of three stages and has defined functions for introduction,\n",
    "    start, the stages, win and fail (which is the user losing the game). \n",
    "    In this game, the user is a young lion named Simba who has to cross \n",
    "    several stages and win the game to be crowned as King of the Pride Lands.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    No previous knowledge of the movie or its plot is necessary to play the game.\n",
    "    The game may also help you acquire some knowledge about wildlife.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    B) Known Bugs and/or Errors:\n",
    "    None detected during testing. Any information on bugs is welcome to help modify the code. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    C) The total run-time of the game to win is under 3 minutes. \n",

    "## 1. casefold() -- used to ensure the code reads the input irrespective of case - \n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. the >> symbol has been at all input prompts to enable the user easily understand that their input comes in that box. \n",
    "## It is like giving a direction to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. The in function has been used in if loops for reading the input responses to ensure that the code correctly\n",
    "## captures responses even if user types in several words or sentence as reposonse. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. time.sleep() function - Sleeping the kernel- has been used as a pause or show that the system is \n",
    "## thinking for a second at some stage of the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. All the user defined functions start with def - for each stage of the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. All if loops come with an else clause at the end - so as to catch any bugs due to any unexpected inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. \\n has been used to go to next line - to make the outputs look appealing to the user by spacing them out well. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. print('='*100) -- has been used to separate stages and also to make the outputs look appealing to the user \n",
